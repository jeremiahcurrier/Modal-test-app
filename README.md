# Suspended Ticket Nuke App

This app has settings shown as checkboxes with correspond to all of Zendesk's different causes of suspension. 

You can select every single suspended ticket in your Zendesk, by cause in the app settings, and delete all of the suspended tickets at once! Yay!

...for those of you that are a bit less like the Hulk and prefer a scalpel over a sledgehammer - this app has something for you to! You can limit your selections to only some instead of all causes of suspension then delete all tickets with any number of causes of suspension.
