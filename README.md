# Suspended Ticket Nuke App

* Bulk delete suspended tickets by cause of suspension
* The causes of suspension are displayed as checkboxes & if checked then suspended tickets with those will be bulk deleted
* By default all settings are set to **False** but any 'cause' in the settings can be modified to 'true'
* The app will count all suspended tickets & filter to just those which are ready to be deleted based on the app's settings.
* The app will display the total number of suspended tickets that meet the selected causes of suspension
* The user is prompted to confirm the results of suspended tickets matched by entering the value into an input field before allowing the bulk deletion event

Pull requests are welcome, but you knew that.
